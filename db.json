        "description": "Hello everyone! In this tutorial I will show you a way to implement JWT Authentication but in this case using MongoDB driver.\nFirst we will create new web api using dotnet cli. Open your terminal and run command: dotnet new webapp - -name=webapi.\nThis will create start boilerplate for our application.\nOpen the crafted application in your favorite code editor, I am using vs-code.\nThis is what you’ll get.\nWe will start by adding MongoDB Driver package to our application, so we can work with our collections.\nIn you terminal run: dotnet add package MongoDB.Driver\nAfter installing, get back to project and open your .csproj file, and you should see:\n<PackageReference Include=”MongoDB.Driver” Version=”2.12.0\" />\nNow we are ready to connect to our Mongo database.",
